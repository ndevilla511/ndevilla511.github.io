For this project, I used many techniques in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a fully responsive dashboard. While there isn't any database or backend functionality for the web app, this showcases my ability to build projects from scratch from the ground up. I implemented the Chart.js library for the graphs and added my own custom mobile menu with jQuery.
